              <p> Climate change is known as long term shifts in tempertures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through different in the solar cycle. But since the 1800's, humans activtes have been the main driver of climate change. Climate change can affect our health, abilty to grow food, housing safety and work.</p>

                 <p> If the weather gets warmer it can lead to Heat waves. Heat waves can cause health risks for children and elderly. Climate change can cause water to evaporate and we wonâ€™t have water anymore and other animals that live in the water and also drink it. Next the sea levels will rise.And also droughts will also start forming. The hotter it gets the more higher risk we have for these impacts.</p>

                 <p> Ways we can stop climate change is by taking your bike or public transportation bus to work or school because if you take a vehicle it can cause greenhouse gasses. Eating Vegatables, fruits, whole grains can slo help stop climate change because it can lower our envirmental impact. In general, producing plant-based foods uses less energy, water, and land and produces fewer greenhouse gas emmissons. Anothdr way to help stop climate change is to not throw food away because when you are throwing food away you're also wasting resources and energy that were used to grow like the produce, pakage, and transport it.  </p>
